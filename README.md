# Markdown repository

This repository is the source of my Confluence workflow. I will use this repo to create the source files from markdown. I will also create a basic GitHub workflow in here with review steps.

I think the workflow condition can be if all reviewers approve, it immediately pushes the changes to master. Upon pushing, Confluence either through a webhook or a plugin parses the new content and publishes it.
